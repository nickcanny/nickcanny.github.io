# There is no such thing as a free lunch.

Nothing is free, if it is free expect nothing from it. Make the most of all of the opportunities that you seek or come into.

The search begins, usually on google to see what business schools are out there and their rank. It starts out as a number game but you have to change that and make the search about you and your fit. Visit the schools and read up on them, read the blogs they publish and the magazines too. You will learn a lot about the school and the faculty just by reading the schools blog. Dig deeper into the professors and their research.
