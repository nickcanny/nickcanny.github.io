Fall is a great time to enjoy the turning of the leaves and the apple crop. The later is dependant on the past weather, from rain to frost. This year was a great year because there was no frost once the, so caled, cold weather ceaced. 

Some of the best apples that I have gotten, for brewing cider, so far have been from western New York, I maybe a bit biased due to I started making hard cider in school located in the wild west of good ole New York.

Brewing is an amazing reaction of biology and chemistry. From sugar, apples and yeast come carbon dioxide, alcohol, and complex flavors. When I first started making cider I tasted it every time I reraced the solution. It was a learning experience in itself, seeing how the cider matured at different stages of fermentation. 

I used english cider yeast which creates a smooth, rich, and warm cider. The third time I used a champagne yeast which creates a cider that resembles a dry champagen, surprisingly enough, who would have thought. The thrid batch was my if it's not broke don't fix it moment.

Live and learn from follys and foes.
