It's funny when you think that something bad happened then realize that it came out the correct way, just not the way you were expecting. In this instance, my first batch of cider brewed at home comes to mind. It was very dry and not what I expected, so I thought that something was wrong but upon talking to the great people of Maltose Express in Monroe, CT I learned that the champagne yeast did it's job. Champagne yeast converts most of the sugars into alcohol and leaves a very dry wine. This year I used a yeast that converted less sugar into alcohol and the results were favorable. 

It’s funny how you read a book or two and get similar advice, the hard part is acting on that advice. Sometimes us stubborn folk need to come to that realization by ourselves but a little guidance doesn’t hurt.  From leadership to happiness you have to look at the world differently than how you looked at it in the past.

Trying to finish some things that I have started in the last years and continue some others is what I will be working on.
