# Iceland, the land of barren yonders.

- 2 cousins
- 1 Iceland
- 1 Dacia Duster 4x4
- 1200 miles of narrow roads
- 1 cabin
- 4 nights
- 5 days
- 1 head cold
- navigator falling asleep time and time again - priceless.


## Day 1 fade to black.
All the time spent plannig, gone. New plans were made in flight to try to better accomidate for the weather and by luck it worked out very well.
Rain and wind followed by sideways snow.


## Day 2, Golden Circle.

Starting the day in darkness at 8 am takes some getting used to, but nothing a liitle photon emmiter can not fix. 
Seemingly inactive volcanos, check.
Closed thermo elcetric powerplant down a snowy road, check.
White out conditions, check.

## Day 3, a nice drive to southern Iceland.

The Idea was to see some Ice and northern lights in the south of Iceland.

We learned that you can not take photos of the northern lights with your phones camera. 

Staying out till 5 am to see the northern lights and seeing the Milky Way Galaxy was worth every second. Even if we had to stop a bunch of times on the way back to the cabin to nap because I felt like death.

## Day 4, Sleep and laundry

I have found in my travels my packing ablilities are very low, if I rolled a d20 I'd probably roll a 1 or 2 every time for packing.

The barren land is so peaceful and beautiful. The sideways weather and small towns with their roundabouts. 

## Day 5, Wake up and smell the cold air coffee and leftover charizo.

waking to a email saying that your flight was overbooked always adds a bit of uncertianty that you really don't need at the end of a trip. Long story short they had seats for us and we made it back to the US in one piece.

Travel suggestion: Get Global Entry (includes TSA PRE check), 100 bucks for 5 years worth every penny.

comedy from Bill Burr and Joe Rogan, it helps to laugh when you get hangry.
a bunch of 90's music that you can sing along to. Props to the little cousin on that one.
